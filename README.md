# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

## Description

An application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an express backend and saves and retrieving note data from a JSON file. A user will be able to write and save notes, deleting notes they no longer need to aid better organisation and task management. It will be especially beneficial for those that need to keep track of a lot of information, removing the possibility of forgetting or inability to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes will allow users to have written information available when needed.
